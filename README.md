_This project has been created as part of the 42 curriculum by [imeulema](https://profile.intra.42.fr/users/imeulema)._
# Description
This projects acts as an introduction to **computer networks**.
Its goal is to configure small-scale networks through a series of 10 exercises to test our understanding of **TCP/IP addressing**. More specifically, the focus of those exercises is set on **subnet masks** and **default gateways**.
# Instructions
The exercises are accessible through the _index.html_ file located at the root of this repository. Configuration files proving all 10 exercises have been made in "training mode" before the evaluation are to be given too.
The evaluation itself has us complete 3 exercises chosen at random between the levels 7 to 10 of the "training mode", which we have to complete in under 15 minutes.
# Resources
## AI disclaimer
42's README requirements asks us to explain how AI was used on each project; I find using AI counterproductive when learning about a subject or concepts I am not yet familiar with, therefore no AI was used in the scope of this project.
